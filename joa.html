            <h2 class="mb-4">About the Cause</h2>
            <img src="img/joa-global.jpg" alt="JOA Global Experience" class="img-fluid rounded mb-4">
            <p>The Bimoba people’s culture and traditions which have been passed onto generations depicting an intergenerational intangible cultural heritage which captivate many interests from near and far. The beauty of our culture is widely recognized with well articulate and energetic dance, drumming, flute and melodies display whenever we pay homage to our ancestors. In Ghana and across the globe, Bimoba people have risen to the top echelon in both formal and informal sectors making us key decision makers and elements of change for our people and all humanity. </p>
            <p>Preserving our culture and traditions for the next generation in this technological era should be paramount to all Bimoba people both home and abroad in other to get the youth accustomed with their true identity. The unification of our people both home and abroad is of high interest among the traditional leaderships who represent all our people under different jurisdictions as there are existing Bimoba unions across the country who are doing well with various cause. Have we considered the Bimoba’s in the diaspora who don’t get to experience and engage with their tribe or as a union which has annual festival to converge all at a location with home away from home experience like never before.</p>
            <p>This project seeks to establish an annual event which will promote and educate all Bimoba’s in abroad about our traditions and culture most especially oral language among the youth growing up in abroad. The focus is to enhance on existing relationships and unions to form a conglomerate body in our quest to project the culture and traditions of our people across the globe.</p>
            <p>Socioeconomic and educational development of the Bimoba’s across the country should be address with various Bimoba individuals, unions, organizations and donors at home and the diaspora to rally support for education, health and economic avenues in Bimoba communities in Ghana. In the education sector, lack of teaching and learning materials coupled with inadequate space, desks and dilapidated classrooms across our communities discourage mass education outreach programs initiated by various governments.</p>
            <p>It is time for us to begin the Bimoba community development agenda which seeks to improve on the life of our people through self-initiated projects and programs to gather financial and educational material support to distribute among schools. Establishing a board to supersede a scholarship scheme for undergraduate and master’s programs in universities across the world. Brilliant Bimoba students will be giving the opportunities to explore global education through partnerships with individuals and organization’s providing financial aid in addition to various educational financial scholarships available to the general public.</p>
            <p>The focus on health is to register all aged, minors and people living with disabilities within the Bimoba communities onto the National Health Insurance Scheme to facilitate easy access to healthcare. Enhance on health education campaigns and programs which promotes good healthy habits among our people liaising with international health donors to support the development of healthcare centers within our communities.</p>
            <p>Advocating for support from corporate bodies, government agencies, individuals and institutions to initiate various projects in our communities. As part of our economic outreach projects, a proposed artisan and technical skills center should be built to provide training in various economic avenues for our people most especially women and the youth. Seeking financial support through grants and donors to equip the women after acquiring various economic and managerial training which these women will be enhance with marketing alliance and techniques to sustain their businesses.</p>
            <p>The hardship facing our people cannot be only addressed by the governments and not even the Bimoba members of parliament has done enough to improve the living standard of our people. It is a general responsibility for all Bimoba’s in abroad to unite and support the development of our communities back home. Providing economic avenues which will reduce the poverty level in our communities through educational workshops, technical supports and programs which will inculcate modern techniques and ethics applied in various endeavor’s. The three (3) days festival will be hold in USA bringing all Bimoba’s across all fifty (50) states to converge at one location to share once in a lifetime experience with music, food, culture and educational activities.</p>
            <p>First day will welcome all guests from Ghana to various accommodation reservations and formal orientation for protocols to be observed. The second day will be preparations towards our main festival with all arrangements regarding food, music, cultural display, and fund raising to support our cause. A tour arrangement to various places will be scheduled for guests who want to enjoy sight-seeing around the city. Invitations will be sent out to all ambassadors, Ghanaians and cultural enthusiasts to join us celebrate our beautiful culture. 
            </p>
            <p>The festival will be climax with Bimoba chiefs from Ghana displaying cultural prowess on the third (3) day of the event. Cultural group from Ghana will entertain the crowd with some of the Bimoba and other musicians joining us to enjoy Bimoba food, drinks and dance. The event will rotate from state to state as an annual event which will incorporate other tribes subsequently setting a good precedent for others to follow. </p>

            <p>The Sankofa Culture Pilgrimage is a global cultural emancipation event launching in 2025. This initiative aims to reconnect people with their heritage and celebrate cultural diversity through immersive experiences and educational activities.</p>
            <p>This project is the global cultural emancipation event which will be launched next year 2025 in Ghana and other international platforms to invite all cultural educators, diaspora communities, curators, students, cultural enthusiasts, tourists, investors, historians, ancestral seekers, traditional educators, and heritage promoters/activists to converge in various parts of the country to learn, enjoy, and experience first-hand knowledge of various cultures.</p>
            <p>The Sankofa Culture Pilgrimage mission is to draw people from all walks of life and especially the diaspora community to come back home and be more accustomed to our diverse cultures as a motivation to let them know the time is now for their return to the motherland.</p>
            <p>Our vision is to bring cultural investors from the diaspora communities to partner with them and create artisan centers to train and empower citizens with entrepreneurship skills to curb the high-rate unemployed population. There will be a series of activities in each region to mark this project as all regions in Ghana are known for a particular culture. Cultural business coffee meetings with potential investors across the country would be part of programs to expose more cultural investment opportunities to foreign investors.</p>
            <p>Drawing the visitor’s attention to our cultural tourist sites will also be one of the core mandates during and after this project. It is imperative to educate the diaspora about the histories our ancestors left behind with empirical evidence to help them reconnect back to their roots as most of them have been told stories of how their ancestors used to live in Africa by their grandparents.</p>
            <p>The pilgrimage activities will run through 2024 to 2025 to allow more time and cultural/tourism experiences of all regions in Ghana to share cultural values with all pilgrims who attend the events.</p>
            <p>The event will be launched in New York and subsequently be promoted in London, Amsterdam, Berlin, Dublin, Brussels, Copenhagen, Toronto, Mexico City, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Doha to gain much attention among global communities abroad. The pilgrimage will begin from the northern part of Ghana, with many cultural histories and experiences such as the Larabanga mosque, Paga crocodile pond, etc., continue through Bono and Ahafo for some beautiful sightseeing at monkey sanctuaries, waterfalls, etc.</p>
            <p>Have a deep cultural interaction in the Ashanti region with a visit to the Manhyia Palace, Lake Bosomtwi, Okomfo Shrine, and the Kente village, etc., with diverse activities which will be climaxed with a kente festival. The central and western parts’ cultural/tourism will show evidence of slavery and its associated activities, Kakum canopy walk while enjoying the sea breeze and a taste of sea foods available to savor.</p>
            <p>Eastern Ghana’s cultural history and tourism have a rich experience for the pilgrims, the stone umbrella, Boti waterfalls, Aburi botanical gardens, Akosombo hydro plant, Atimpoku Adomi bridge, etc. The experience in the Volta part of Ghana culturally/tourism will allow pilgrims to learn various traditional dances and visit beautiful tourist sites i.e., Fort Prinzenstein, Keta, Mount Afadjato, Wli waterfalls, Tafi Atome monkey sanctuary, and cultural village, etc.</p>
            <p>The event will climax in the Greater Accra region with a cultural workshop and training for pilgrims who will sign up to be part of it. Our cultural experiences across the country will be shared at the workshop and documented to be a research material for others to use. There will be a sendoff ceremony for pilgrims to celebrate with each other their cultural rebirth and exchange contacts, pleasantries to begin new friendships across the world.</p>
